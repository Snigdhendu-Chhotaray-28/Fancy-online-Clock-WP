⏰ Interactive Time & Calendar Visualizer

The Interactive Time & Calendar Visualizer is a visually rich, real-time web project that reimagines how time and date are displayed. It combines an analog clock, vertical strip clock, and a multi-layer circular calendar into a single synchronized interface, offering both functionality and aesthetic appeal.

✨ Features

🕰️ 1. Real-Time Analog Clock
Displays the current time using animated hour, minute, and second hands, updated every second with smooth rotational calculations based on actual system time.

📊 2. Vertical Strip Clock (Digital Concept)
A unique strip-based clock where hours, minutes, and seconds scroll vertically, visually representing changing digits in real time.

🌀 3. Circular Calendar System
Multiple concentric circles dynamically represent:

* Seconds (0–59)
* Minutes (0–59)
* Hours (0–23)
* Date (1–31)
* Day (Sun–Sat)
* Month (Jan–Dec)
* Year range (2010–2029)
  The current value in each circle is automatically highlighted.

🎯 4. Smart Highlighting Logic
The active second, minute, hour, date, day, month, and year are visually highlighted using the `.high_light` class for instant readability.
